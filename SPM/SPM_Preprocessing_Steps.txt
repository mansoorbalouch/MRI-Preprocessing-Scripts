This file contains a brief description of the (spatial processing) preprocessing pipeline followed using SPM12: (SPM12 only used for preprocessing MRI and doesn't return region-wise and surface-based measurements)


=> Skull stripping
=> Slice timing correction
=> Realign
=> Afiine registration to standard space (MNI) through re-orientation
=> Tissue segmentation -> warping
=> Bias field correction
=> Intensity normalization


-> 1st and 2nd level analysis
